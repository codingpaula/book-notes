# 2.1 IONS:

- sodium = Na+
- potassium = K+
- calcium = Ca2+
- cloride = Cl-
positive charge -> cations
negative charge -> anion

intracellular and extracellular concentrations:
- intra: K+ & A- molecules
- extra: Na+ & Cl-, Ca2+

### ion channels:
molecules (A-) can not pass!

### concentration asymmetry:
##### passive redistribution:
A- attract K+ and repel Cl-, create a concentration gradient

##### active transport:
ionic pumps pump ions in and out of the cell, help to maintain concentration gradient

## 2.1.1 Nernst Potential:
two forces:
- concentration gradients
- electric potential gradients
drive each ion species through membrance channels

equilibrium:
both exert equal and opposite forces that counterbalance each other
-> net cross-membrane current = 0

Nernst equilibrium potentials

## 2.1.2 Ionic Currents and Conductances:
`V = membrane potential`
