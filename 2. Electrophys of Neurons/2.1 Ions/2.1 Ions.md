# 2.1 IONS:

- sodium = Na+
- potassium = K+
- calcium = Ca2+
- cloride = Cl-
positive charge -> cations
negative charge -> anion

intracellular and extracellular concentrations:
- intra: K+ & A- molecules
- extra: Na+ & Cl-, Ca2+

### ion channels:
molecules (A-) can not pass!

### concentration asymmetry:
##### passive redistribution:
A- attract K+ and repel Cl-, create a concentration gradient

##### active transport:
ionic pumps pump ions in and out of the cell, help to maintain concentration gradient

## 2.1.1 Nernst Potential:
two forces:
- concentration gradients
- electric potential gradients
drive each ion species through membrance channels

equilibrium:
both exert equal and opposite forces that counterbalance each other
-> net cross-membrane current = 0

Nernst equilibrium potentials

## 2.1.2 Ionic Currents and Conductances:
`V = membrane potential`
`E_ion = Nernst equilibrium potential of that ion`
`I_K = net K+ current`
when `V = E_K` then `I_K = 0`

### Conductances:
`g_ion = ion conductance`
`V - E_ion = ion "driving force"`

constant conductance -> current is "Ohmic"
conductances may depend on time, V, pharmacological agents (neurotransmitters neuromodules, ...) -> allows a neuron to generate a pike

## 2.1.3 Equivalent Circuit:
electrical properties presented in equivalent circuits
`I = total current` that flows across a patch of a cell membrane
`I = sum of the membrane capacitive current CV_dot`
`I = CV_dot + I_Na + I_Ca + I_K + I_Cl`
`V_dot = dV/dt` derivative of V with respect to t
-> needed because it takes time to charge the membrane
`CV_dot = I - I_Na - I_Ca - I_K - I_Cl`
or you can substitute each `I_ion` with its ionic current formula: `I_ion = g_ion * (V - E_ion)`
